    "Trust Wallet": [0.8, 0.7]
    "Exodus Wallet": [0.6, 0.8]
    "Our Target Product": [0.9, 0.9]


he product should be a Bitcoin wallet that prioritizes security and user-friendliness. It should allow efficient management and transactions of Bitcoin.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Secure storage of Bitcoin", "P0"),
    ("User-friendly interface", "P0"),
    ("Efficient transaction management", "P0"),
    ("View transaction history", "P1"),
    ("Receive balance change notifications", "P1")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The UI should be clean and minimalistic, with clear navigation. The main screen should display the current Bitcoin balance, with options to send or receive Bitcoin. There should also be a separate section for viewing transaction history and another for settings and notifications.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points.

## Implementation approach
We will use Flask as our web framework due to its simplicity and flexibility. For the Bitcoin transactions, we will use the bitcoinlib library which supports Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For the front-end, we will use Bootstrap to ensure our application is responsive and user-friendly. SQLite will be used for the database to store user information and transaction history. We will also use Flask-SocketIO for real-time balance change notifications.

## Logic Analysis

    ("user.py", "Contains User class and its methods, should be implemented first as it is a prerequisite for Wallet and Transaction"),

    ("transaction.py", "Contains Transaction class and its methods, depends on Wallet class"),
    ("notification.py", "Contains Notification class and its methods, depends on User class"),
    ("templates/*.html", "Contains the frontend of the application, depends on all backend classes"),
    ("static/css/main.css", "Contains the styles for the frontend, can be developed in parallel with HTML templates"),
    ("static/js/main.js", "Contains the JavaScript for the frontend, depends on all backend classes and HTML templates")

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'bitcoinlib' is a Python library for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It provides functionalities for creating and managing wallets, making transactions, etc.
'flask' is a web framework for Python. It is used to create the backend of the application.
'flask_socketio' is a Flask extension for handling WebSocket connections. It is used for real-time balance change notifications.
'bcrypt' is a Python library for hashing passwords. It is used to secure user passwords.
'bootstrap' and 'jquery' are frontend libraries. They are used to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. We need to start with the backend classes (User, Wallet, Transaction, Notification) as they are the prerequisites for the frontend. The frontend (HTML templates, CSS, JavaScript) can be developed in parallel once the backend is ready.
